# CS247-Project

## Data
As github is limiting the size of data can be uploaded, you can see all our data here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnlQlLereWpZdQ29NMiAWvKy42gf7Z3v?usp=sharing

train.csv, test.csv and embeddings are directly downloaed from Kaggle. Splited_train.csv and splited_test.csv
are the results of 8:2 spliting of the original train.csv (We do our fine tuning based on these 2 files)


## Notebooks
### Note: all the file paths are in local (i.e: train_path=pd.read_csv("./data/train.csv"), please create a local folder for data to store the CSVs
logistic_regression.ipynb: The notebook for running logisitic regression
